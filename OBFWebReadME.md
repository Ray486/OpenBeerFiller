OBFWeb.h will be the web interface part of the code if we transfer the main code to ESP32
platform and run both the main controlling software as well as the web interface on the 
same controller eg. the ESP32
The web interface was originally written to run on the NodeMCU (ESP8266) but this does not
have sufficient Analogue pins to monitor the three Beer sense inputs currently employed on
the Arduino UNO code.
